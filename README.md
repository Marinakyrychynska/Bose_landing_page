Bose_landing_page


I made the website. The site has a header, menu with navigation, four sections and footer.
During development, I use:
  -  SASS preprocessor;
  -  BEM methodology;
  - used grid and flex to place elements;
  - used transition for smooth increase of icons and pictures as links on hover.

The mockup and demo are below.
